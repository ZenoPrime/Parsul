Users can get "cashback" if the AI agents can find better (cheaper) links to the products they paid for before the order is put through. For more context I plan on implementing a cron job to checkout all the orders to the various websites through my account, once a week (likely every friday). And between those fridays, we'll have the AI agents occasionally make checks to see if there are any cheaper links to the products they paid for. If there are, we'll send a notification to the user that there are cheaper links available. And if the user clicks on the notification, we'll send them to the cheaper link. And if the user doesn't click on the notification, we'll just continue with the order as normal. If we buy the cheaper product, we can offer the user about 80% of the difference in price. That 80% would be refunded as a stablecoin which the user can use to buy other products. That would require an embedded wallet feature which a platform called Privy would provide. Here's a link to their docs https://docs.privy.io/wallets/overview.

So how I see it working is that privy can handle the blockchain & crypto stuff and we can handle the rest in terms of user data and personalization and order management.

From the docs I see that privy offers both client and server side auth processes. I think the server side auth process is what we'll need. As we might be adapting the service to other countries and platforms like a whatsapp bot or FlutterFlow app.
