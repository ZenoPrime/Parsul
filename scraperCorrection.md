Now I'll mention a few things I like followed by a few that I'd want to see improved.

### Things I like:
1. It shows me multiple links that it checked for the target price.
2. It let me know that there were no offers for the device.


### Thing's I want improved:
1. I'd appreciate if the links included stores & sellers outside of Sierra Leone.
2. I'd like it to show me the lowest price it found.
3. I'd like it to show me the condition of the item
4. It would be nice if it did a price conversion for links outside of Sierra Leone. Let's consider 1 United States Dollar to be 24.3 Sierra Leonean Leones, 1 Great Britain Pound to be 28.5 Sierra Leonean Leones, and 1 Euro to be 26.7 Sierra Leonean Leones.
5. We can charge the customer for the API usage as part of the service cost whenever the customer completes an order.

From the overall flow, I'd appreciate if in the recommendation call it mentioned the price as the lowest available price if this is the first time the item is being recommended. If it's been recommended before, it should show the last bought price. I suppose this means that the recommendation should be stored in a database.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
